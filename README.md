## Welcome!

My name is Alex Goodman. I hope you find my Github repos helpful and informative.

### About Me

I care deeply about the open source community and researching next-generation technology. I'm an avid TypeScript / JavaScript engineer, and I wake up everyday to leverage that creating great applications with React, React Native, Node, Nexus, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. Quality assurance means a lot to me, so I focus on automated testing (BDD/TDD) alongside a continuous improvement mentality.

I AM passionate for outstanding designs and magical experiences. <br />
I VALUE the design community and the open source community to build great products. <br />
I WILL set realistic expectations and be honest and transparent.
