**Welcome!**

My name is Alex Goodman. My Github is home to many of my ideas from over the years. Enjoy!

**About Me**

I’ve been creating products since I was just a kid, driven to change the world through technology. This led me to getting contract work before I graduated high school, so I got my start early, and ultimately chose a full-time job over college. I am self-taught.

Now, after 10+ years as a software developer, I am continuing to build new and exciting applications with my preferred languages: Rust, TypeScript, Python, C++, and C#. I have experience with most major languages and frameworks, having become “language-agnostic”.

I prefer to take on the hard problems. I enjoy working on complex tasks involving rich and demanding applications, but I have built many simpler products as well.

When it comes to serving clients, I find that being rapid and fast, responsive, and transparent leads to the greatest results. You can expect no less when working with me.

Thank you for visiting!
